## Inputs

### `kube-score-version`

*(Optional)*: The version of kube-score to use. Defaults to the latest available.

### `manifests-folders`

**Required**: An array of relative paths containing manifests to analyze with kube-score (separated with commas). It is mandatory to establish a wildcard for the files or the concrete filename.

Example: `./manifests/*.yml,./other/manifests/*.yml`

### `ignore-exit-code`

*(Optional)*: Will ignore the exit code provided by `kube-score`, will always pass the check. This could be useful in case of using the action in an information way.

### `output-file`

Each analysis is separated by a text block.
